This simple thought holds a bigger truth. It represents the way ACU does business, their promise to the members and a commitment to the communities they live and work in. ACU is guided by the principles of ""values-based banking"", meaning that the credit union remains financially strong while being socially, environmentally and ethically responsible. ACU believes that money can and should, be used for good. To bring financial comfort, to help people's lives and to improve the environment. ACU is fortunate to be in a position to be able to use the credit union's expertise and resources to nurture self-reliant and sustainable communities, to help those less fortunate, and to help members achieve the quality of life they're seeking. All the while, ACU remains critically aware of the impact of business decisions on employees, members, the environment and on the communities their credit union serves. ACU will never forget that their members are also the owners of Assiniboine Credit Union. They've shaped the credit union, they're pretty happy with the results and feel good about being part of something bigger, a financial co-operative that's dedicated to the triple bottom line of improving the lives of people, bettering the planet and creating prosperity.",,,,,,,,,,
