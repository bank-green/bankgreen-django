18,Center-Invest Bank (Russia),1,,1,Russia,https://www.centrinvest.ru/en/,none,,,"History
<p>Center-invest Bank was founded in 1992 by southern Russia’s first privatised enterprises and a team of university professors. The bank rapidly became something of a “laboratory” for the region, providing solutions to the problems of reform in Russia, introducing best international practice, and promoting southern Russia internationally. In 1993 Center-invest Bank produced Russia’s first corporate governance handbook. In 2002, together with IFC, the Bank developed a comprehensive set of policies and internal regulations to ensure the transparency and effectiveness of its operations and to protect the interests of its shareholders, employees and customers. International financial institutions EBRD and DEG became Bank’s shareholders in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Later, in 2008, Erste Group Bank AG became the shareholder. In 2017, two investment vehicles managed by Switzerland-based responsAbility Investments have purchased a 10% stake of  Center-invest Bank. ResponsAbility Investments is one of the world’s leading asset managers in the field of development investments, with a strong focus on sustainable development of small business and financial inclusion in developing economies on the basis of innovations and principles of environmental and socially responsible management. The bank’s successful work contributed to southern Russia’s dynamic economic growth and the region’s increased role in the Russian economy as a whole.</p>Center-invest Bank was founded in 1992 by southern Russia’s first privatised enterprises and a team of university professors.

Founded in 1923 by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, a textile union of mostly immigrants in New York City, Amalgamated Bank became the first financial institution for the working class in a time when banking solely benefited corporations and the wealthy. Amalgamated pioneered free savings accounts, free checking accounts, unsecured credit, affordable housing loans, and second chance bank accounts for those people who had credit problems in the past.

Since then, the bank has grown to serve those who help make the world more just, compassionate and sustainable. Their extensive experience, financial resources and community of like-minded customers offers labor unions, philanthropies, political campaigns, socially and environmentally responsible corporations, as well as individuals, a unique set of financial services enabling them to lead the charge to improve our communities and our country. It’s this commitment to working people and the organizations that support them that continues to set them apart from other banks.","

<p>Amalgamated Bank was founded in 1923 by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America with one primary goal – to provide working class people with the banking services they were refused by other banks. The bank was the first bank to provide free savings and checking accounts. They developed unsecured credit products so that struggling workers could borrow money and made it easier for immigrants to send money back home. Over time, Amalgamated became the go-to bank for unions and for progressive companies, organizations and individuals.</p>Amalgamated Bank was founded in 1923 by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America with one primary goal – to provide working class people with the banking services they were refused by other banks.

Amalgamated takes pride in funding food banks, day care centers, women’s health centers, affordable housing projects and environmentally friendly projects.

<p>Ekobanken was founded in 1996 and began operations in 1998. When the bank started it took over the operations of a savings association, Ekosparkassan, which was the result of a merger of a gift fund and a finance initiative. This merger was rooted in the 1980’s when a group of people were inspired by the early anthroposophical banking initiatives in Europe: still embodied in the activities of fellow GABV members such as GLS Bank and Triodos Bank.</p>Ekobanken was founded in 1996 and began operations in 1998.

<p>In the early years a lot of work was done to change Swedish law, making it possible for a small bank like Ekobanken to exist and grow with a capital level below the required minimum. After relocating the head office to Skäve Farm outside the village of Järna the bank has, despite limited resources, made itself visible in society. Ekobanken takes part in discussions about local and social economy, renewables, farming, housing and social co-operatives, and adds to the debate about how to create a sustainable society.</p>In the early years a lot of work was done to change Swedish law, making it possible for a small bank like Ekobanken to exist and grow with a capital level below the required minimum.

<p>In 2005 the first Ekobanken office in the Old Town of Stockholm opened making it possible to meet new groups of clients. The following year Ekobanken launched an internet service together with the big Swedish bank, Nordea, this provided the necessary banking infrastructure for company clients of Ekobanken. Since 2009 Ekobanken has had a permanent representation in Gothenburg and in 2013 a larger office in Stockholm opened, replacing the previous office.</p>In 2005 the first Ekobanken office in the Old Town of Stockholm opened making it possible to meet new groups of clients.

<p>The bank´s roots are to be found in the third-sector organisations, of voluntary work and of international cooperation. The first experience of ethically oriented finance in Italy is represented by the MAG cooperative societies (self-management mutual associations). Their traditional aim is to raise savings among their members and to finance socially oriented projects. Pushed by some new legal rules in the 1990s, some of the organisations involved in ethically oriented finance initiated a fundraising campaign in December 1998, in order to obtain a banking license. This was the first time that a banking institution, with the purpose of operating exclusively in sustainable and alternative finance, filed a request and obtained such an authorisation in Italy.</p>The bank´s roots are to be found in the third-sector organisations, of voluntary work and of international cooperation.

Started in 2007, Beneficial State Bank came from a shared vision to start a bank that finances community-based businesses, builds the long-term prosperity of responsible consumers and supports companies that have a commitment to the environment. BSB has a one of a kind ownership structure-- its profits, when distributed, can only be distributed to Beneficial State Foundation to support our communities and environment. By design, the community is the shareholder that BSB serves, not special interests of any one group.

Note: This company or an affiliated individual or entity has made a philanthropic contribution to B Lab within the parameters of its conflict of interest policy. For more information visit the funders and finances section of this website.","

<p>The origins of Crédit Coopératif go back to the late 19th century – Crédit Coopératif celebrated its 120-year anniversary in 2013 – when a group of co-operators decided to set up their own bank. Since then, it has regularly developed its activities, customer base and network while remaining true to its vocation as a cooperative for legal entities that’s accessible to individual clients. It is a banker for the Social Economy: co-operatives, mutual organisations, small businesses, trade associations and work committees, public interest organisations and socially-responsible companies in social housing, healthcare, care and services for vulnerable people, environment, culture, education and research, microfinance institutions, among others. It is also a pioneer of solidarity-based finance.</p>The origins of Crédit Coopératif go back to the late 19th century – Crédit Coopératif celebrated its 120-year anniversary in 2013 – when a group of co-operators decided to set up their own bank.

<p>The Crédit Coopératif Group has developed through external acquisitions between 1994 and 1998. In 2003, Crédit Coopératif joined the banking group ‘Groupe Banque Populaire’, with an agreement that guarantees its management independence, its identity and its brand. This agreement has been transferred to ‘BPCE’ (the merged group of Groupe Banque Populaire and Groupe Caisse d’Epargne): Within the terms of the French ‘Monetary and Financial Code’, BPCE is Crédit Coopératif’s central body. As such, it ensures its liquidity and solvency, and Crédit Coopératif also shares its rating.</p>The Crédit Coopératif Group has developed through external acquisitions between 1994 and 1998.

<p>Cultura was founded as a savings and loan cooperative in 1986 and obtained a full licence as a savings bank in 1996. Since then the bank has grown from a total asset base of just €5 million to €55 million today. The founders of the bank wanted to channel funds to organic farming. At the time this was considered risky and shunned by conventional banks. They also took special interest in private initiatives in the cultural sphere, in particular in education.</p>Cultura was founded as a savings and loan cooperative in 1986 and obtained a full licence as a savings bank in 1996.

<p>Since then the activities of the bank have broadened to include small enterprises involved in fair trade, traditional crafts, and distribution of various ecological products. From the beginning the bank has relied solely on funding itself through customer deposits. The bank’s equity consists of a core fund and capital issued through an equity-like instrument called equity certificates, specially designed for savings banks. The governing body of the bank is elected by four groups; the customers, the equity certificate owners, the employees and one representative designated by the local authorities.</p>Since then the activities of the bank have broadened to include small enterprises involved in fair trade, traditional crafts, and distribution of various ecological products.

<p>For GLS Bank, conducting a professional, sustainable banking business means the incorporation of social, ecological and economic criteria. Secure investments, credit policies and monetary transactions that <em>make sense</em> are its core business. GLS understands ‘social’ to be people in their entirety, whose material, emotional and mental needs should be the focus of economic activities. GLS  considers ‘ecological’ to be the task of maintaining and developing the basis for the Earth´s livelihood. The bank regards ‘economy’ as an instrument for achieving these first two goals as efficiently as possible. The money of its customers is invested exclusively in companies and projects whose performance under the above mentioned criteria is outstanding.</p>For GLS Bank, conducting a professional, sustainable banking business means the incorporation of social, ecological and economic criteria.

<p>The GLS Bank was the first social and ecological bank in Germany. The bank was founded in 1974 and originally focused on ecologic, social and cultural projects, such as anthroposophic schools, Demeter farms and communal living projects. Over time, the focus has widened, thus including other independent schools (e.g. Montessori schools) and organic farms into its portfolio. After the accident at Tschernobyl in 1986, other sectors were introduced, such as renewable energy projects. In 1989, the first wind energy fund was established by the bank and in 2003 GLS Bank took over the activities of Ökobank, an ethically and ecologically oriented bank in Germany. Nowadays, following the financial crisis the demand for sustainable banking products has risen, hence, resulting in high growth of GLS Bank. It operates in seven branch offices in Germany since it took over the activities of IntegraBank in 2008.</p>The GLS Bank was the first social and ecological bank in Germany.

<p>Nearly thirty years ago, rural America gained an economic development partner when Bill and Hillary Clinton, Rob Walton, Mohammad Yunus, the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, and others came together around a central idea – that the economic challenges facing rural America could in part be addressed through the creation of a financial organisation focused solely on serving the underserved.</p>Nearly thirty years ago, rural America gained an economic development partner when Bill and Hillary Clinton, Rob Walton, Mohammad Yunus, the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, and others came together around a central idea – that the economic challenges facing rural America could in part be addressed through the creation of a financial organisation focused solely on serving the underserved.

<p>Collectively known as, Southern Bancorp, it is today a $1.1 billion asset organisation with over 80,000 customers and 41 branches located primarily in underserved markets like Southern Arkansas and the Mississippi Delta. Southern’s growth and strength can be attributed to its commitment to sustainably providing responsible, responsive and innovative financial products and financial development services that create real economic opportunity driven by building an individual’s net worth. It is this core belief that drives the Southern’s efforts as studies have shown that as individuals build net worth, economic opportunity is not only created for them, but for the next generation as well.</p>Collectively known as, Southern Bancorp, it is today a $1.1 billion asset organisation with over 80,000 customers and 41 branches located primarily in underserved markets like Southern Arkansas and the Mississippi Delta.

<p>In 1994 Sabine and Horst P. Popp had the progressive idea to found a bank that combines both ecological and economic issues. After an intense phase of preparation UmweltBank received a full banking license in 1997. Until 2001 core competencies were built up by implementing green savings products as well as loans for wind farms, solar projects and sustainable housing.</p>In 1994 Sabine and Horst P.

<p>In 2001 UmweltBank went public having its shares listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The further years were dedicated to expand financial and advisory competencies of the institution. The range of products was extended by profit participation certificates in 2003 and project profit participation certificates in 2004. In 2007 the bank introduced financial solutions for builders cooperatives followed by straightforward loans that made it easier for private clients to finance solar projects.</p>In 2001 UmweltBank went public having its shares listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

<p>In 2015 Stefan Weber and Goran Bašić moved up to management henceforth striving to develop UmweltBank into a green finance platform. The year after UmweltBank placed the first green CoCo-Bond and with UmweltProjekt-Beteiligungen AG (UPG) it formed a subsidiary for managing assets. With Jürgen Koppmann moving up to management in 2017 the future of UmweltBank got shaped more precisely by soon after presenting an up-to-date brand profile and a forward-looking strategy. In 2020 UmweltBank issued its first own environmental investment fund. Furthermore, Stefan Weber left the Board of Management and the company.</p>In 2015 Stefan Weber and Goran Bašić moved up to management henceforth striving to develop UmweltBank into a green finance platform.

<p>Alternative Bank Switzerland (ABS) aims to further the common good and to protect people and nature through its business activities so that the world remains worth living in – both now and in the future. It does not pursue profit maximisation. Instead, it follows ethical principles in all its business activities. As a pioneer in social and ecological banking, it sets an encouraging example for the financial industry and is a model for other banks in Switzerland.</p>Alternative Bank Switzerland (ABS) aims to further the common good and to protect people and nature through its business activities so that the world remains worth living in – both now and in the future. It does not pursue profit maximisation. Instead, it follows ethical principles in all its business activities. As a pioneer in social and ecological banking, it sets an encouraging example for the financial industry and is a model for other banks in Switzerland.
","
<p>The founding of ABS goes back to a social movement consisting of major environmental, social and development organisations and private persons that fought for an alternative, value-based approach to banking at the end of the 1980s. By 1990 it had obtained the authorisation of the Federal Banking Commission and collected the required share capital to begin operations. Its head office in Olten was opened in the same year. Amongst other non-conventional products, the Innovation Fund Association was set up by the bank in 1996 to support projects that are unable to obtain financing from traditional banks. In 2002, ABS expanded its product range to include socially responsible investing and impact investing. An analytical tool developed by ABS, the ABS Property Rating, was launched in 2004 to assess the sustainability of buildings. Since 2012, ABS has controlled all real estate finance with respect to urban sprawl. Since 2014, ABS has offered managed accounts with a special emphasis on impact in its range of investment advisory services. Today, ABS has more than 33,000 clients, 6,500 shareholders and assets under management in the order of CHF 2 billion. It operates in two national languages (German and French) and at three locations (Olten, Zurich and Lausanne). In 2019, it will launch the first investment fund of its own and open an office in Geneva.</p>The founding of ABS goes back to a social movement consisting of major environmental, social and development organisations and private persons that fought for an alternative, value-based approach to banking at the end of the 1980s.

<p>The first steps towards the founding of Merkur Cooperative Bank were taken in 1982 with the forming of a credit and loan association. In 1985 Merkur merged with another independent initiative to form the Co-op Bank, and received a banking license. Merkur opened its first office in Aalborg in 1985. In 1992 it established a branch in Copenhagen (which became Head Office in 2004) and is nowadays present in the four major cities of Denmark.</p>The first steps towards the founding of Merkur Cooperative Bank were taken in 1982 with the forming of a credit and loan association.

","HISTORY
<p>Banco Popular is an institution regulated by the National Banking and Insurance Commission (CNBS). It comes with a share capital of $ 23.0 million with the participation of international shareholding partners, such as: Bamboo Finance, IFC of the World Bank, FMO of the Government of the Netherlands, BIO of the Government of Belgium and the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE). Banco Popular was born with the purpose of supporting the micro and small business, because it plays a fundamental role in creating jobs, reducing poverty, and economic growth of Honduran families and therefore the country. We support the needs of working capital and fixed assets of these economic sectors in an agile, personalized, friendly, and safe way. Banco Popular, in addition to offering a range of credit products, we offer the services of savings collection, fixed-term deposits, checking accounts, insurance, sending and receiving remittances, payment of utilities at the teller window, life and debt insurance, family medical and home assistance, among others. Since May 2010, the international shareholders: Bamboo Finance, IFC, FMO, BIO and BCIE decided to acquire 99.32% of the stocks of Banco Popular Covelo, S.A. and capitalize the Bank with 120.6 million of lempiras. In September 2010, Banco Popular developed a five-year Strategic Plan in which the Vision, Mission and Values were redefined, as well as the global strategy. This plan started from line managers, middle management and senior management. As a result of the new shareholding composition in August 2011, the Bank’s Board of Directors and Shareholders decided to change the name of the Bank to “BANCO POPULAR” through a change in corporate image and brand. Banco Popular currently has a broad network of 26 agencies with coverage in 13 departments of the country.</p>Banco Popular is an institution regulated by the National Banking and Insurance Commission (CNBS).

<p>In Caja Arequipa the bank directs all efforts to help customers develop and benefit from services offered. This is certainly a challenge that keeps the bank connected to a mission and allows the bank to understand, in every day life, their purpose for existing. With such strength the bank promotes a variety of loan and savings products, always holding the micro and small entrepreneur at the centre of its business. This small and micro enterprise sector represents over 60% of  Caja Arequipa’s loan portfolio (working capital and fixed assets) and the sector is the primary player in helping the bank fulfil their sustainability mission. The bank also offers other products such as mortgages, auto and consumer loans.</p>In Caja Arequipa the bank directs all efforts to help customers develop and benefit from services offered.

<p>LAPO MFB’s engagement in microfinance is much more than business as usual. It is about the development of people, particularly women. After several years of supporting the businesses of poor women, the bank’s aim is to continuously provide women with the capacity to actively participate in the economy and ensure inclusion. The bank’s desire is to reach the underbanked; this informs their wide network reach of 384 branches in rural communities. Part of LAPO’s goals is to include a larger proportion of women into their financial scope; this is because women form a greater percentage of the financially excluded, and this is why 92% of the client base is women.</p>LAPO MFB’s engagement in microfinance is much more than business as usual.

","History
<p>Opportunity Bank Serbia is a member of “Opportunity International” – Network of Banks and microfinance organizations which was founded in Chicago in 1971 and today has over 9 million clients in 22 countries around the globe. Opportunity Bank is active in Serbia since 2002, when it was first established with the support from USAID as Opportunity Savings Bank. The main goal of the Savings Bank was to provide financing to individuals, micro and small businesses excluded from access to banks. In 2005, all savings banks and MFIs providing microcredits in Serbia had been required by the Central bank to comply with the new Law on Banks which closed the category of savings banks and required all savings banks that wanted to continue their activities in Serbia to transform into commercial banks. This resulted in the conversion of Opportunity Savings Bank into Opportunity Bank in 2007 (hereinafter OBS) which was the only savings bank that succeeded to transform into a full-service Bank in compliance with the new Law. Thanks to the consistent fieldwork approach and personalized service adjusted to our typical micro-client, Opportunity Bank is today well-known as the dominant player in the Financial Inclusion industry in Serbia.</p>Opportunity Bank Serbia is a member of “Opportunity International” – Network of Banks and microfinance organizations which was founded in Chicago in 1971 and today has over 9 million clients in 22 countries around the globe.

<p>The First MicroFinance Bank – Tajikistan (FMFB-T) is affiliated with the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) – a group of development agencies working in health, education, culture and rural and economic development. It was founded in August 2003 primarily for conducting microfinance activities, taking over the portfolio of microfinance institutions run by other AKDN agencies in the country. The initial shareholders of FMFB-T were Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, a leading investor in Africa, South and Central Asia with a focus on building economically sound enterprises and Aga Khan Foundation, provider of community driven solutions to development challenges. The shareholder base increased subsequently following investments from International Finance Corporation, KfW and Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance. It started its operations with two branches in 2004 and won the Microfinance Transparency award within two years of its operations. FMFB-T has a strong presence in the rural and semi-rural areas where the concentration of the poor is the highest in Tajikistan. The lending focus of the Bank broadened with SME financing activities being included in the year 2011. The Bank joined the National Payment System ‘Korti Milli’ in 2013 to offer card services to its clients with ATM and merchant payment facilities.</p>The First MicroFinance Bank – Tajikistan (FMFB-T) is affiliated with the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) – a group of development agencies working in health, education, culture and rural and economic development.

<p>‘We didn’t specifically set out to be in the social change business. This role as a change agent came about naturally as a result of our co-operative business model. As a financial co-operative, we exist for the sole benefit of our members and their communities and, as a result, act in their best interest.’</p>‘We didn’t specifically set out to be in the social change business.

<p>From the very start, Vancity did things a little differently. Vancity was the first financial institution to offer mortgages on properties in Vancouver’s working-class East End, and later the first in Canada to offer mortgages to women without a male co-signor. Vancity earned a reputation for providing credit to those who had difficulty getting it anywhere else.

","History
<p>Verity Credit Union has a long history in Washington, where it was first chartered in 1933 as Postal Workers Credit Union #8. Though we’ve had a few names over the years, we consistently served government employees as part of our original field of membership.  With the expansion of serving anyone who lives, works or worships in Washington, we changed our name to Verity in 2003 to mark the transition of a new era.</p>Verity Credit Union has a long history in Washington, where it was first chartered in 1933 as Postal Workers Credit Union #8.

With the expansion of serving anyone who lives, works or worships in Washington, we changed our name to Verity in 2003 to mark the transition of a new era.
<p>Since our founding, Verity has embodied the credit union cooperative principles.  We are there for our members when they need us. For much of our existence this has meant providing support for our members when they faced challenging situations, such as government shutdown or layoffs.  When the recession impacted our members, Verity brought financial counselors on staff to provide much needed service (and hope) to our members who were struggling to navigate this time. We continue to look for, and act in, ways to serve as trusted advisors for our members.</p>Since our founding, Verity has embodied the credit union cooperative principles.

We continue to look for, and act in, ways to serve as trusted advisors for our members.
<p>Verity’s current assets exceed $500 million, classifying us as a mid-size credit union.  We provide all the same product and service offerings of a large institution, while remaining personable. We offer full service branches around Puget Sound, plus full service mortgage and investment services.</p>Verity’s current assets exceed $500 million, classifying us as a mid-size credit union.

","Structure
<p>Verity is a not-for-profit financial cooperative 100% owned by our 30,000 members. We are guided by a volunteer board of directors and supervisory committee who ensure that the actions of the credit union are both financially sound and in alignment with our mission and values.  Our management and board of directors are easy accessible to members—members have a voice that is heard. Since there are no stockholders, Verity directs all “profits” toward providing better products, services and rates for members.</p>Verity is a not-for-profit financial cooperative 100% owned by our 30,000 members.

<p>At Verity, we do things a little different—we do things the Verity Way.  That means we strive to make it easy to do business. We work to resolve issues for our member-owners both operationally and emotionally. We look to find a way to say “yes” to our members, while valuing their time. Making financial issues simple to understand and avoiding complex language are important factors in how we approach our members, as is protecting our members’ confidence. Overall, when we work with a member we take the necessary steps to own the relationship and move the member forward in every possible way.</p>At Verity, we do things a little different—we do things the Verity Way.

",,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.gabv.org/members/verity-credit-union,"Market Focus, Products and Services
<p>Credit unions began as a way for local communities to band together for the good of the group.  We’re getting back to those roots.  We invest our time and resources in the neighborhoods where we have branches.  We approach marketing at a micro-community level, focusing on the neighborhoods surrounding our branches.  At Verity, it isn’t about being as big as possible—it’s about doing our best for our members and helping our communities grow and thrive.</p>Credit unions began as a way for local communities to band together for the good of the group.

At Verity, it isn’t about being as big as possible—it’s about doing our best for our members and helping our communities grow and thrive.
<p>Like most other financial institutions, we offer a broad spectrum of deposit and loan products, as well as everyday financial management services.  Based on our commitment to the community, Verity also strives to develop and offer products that meet our members’ needs and reflect our mission and values.  For example, Verity’s Sustainable Lending program features partnerships with solar panel contractors, bicycle shops and auto dealerships, to assist members with the costs of solar home energy systems, bicycles, and fuel efficient vehicles.</p>Like most other financial institutions, we offer a broad spectrum of deposit and loan products, as well as everyday financial management services.

<p>Verity has a unique partnership with Business Impact Northwest, a non-profit economic development organization created to serve under-banked entrepreneurs by providing access to capital and comprehensive business technical assistance.  Verity, along with two other local credit unions, provides funding for micro-loans through BIN. The University of Washington Foster School of Business students join the group to provide consulting to small businesses and non-profits.</p>Verity has a unique partnership with Business Impact Northwest, a non-profit economic development organization created to serve under-banked entrepreneurs by providing access to capital and comprehensive business technical assistance.
