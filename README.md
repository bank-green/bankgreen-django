# Bank Green Django App

This is a [python django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application for cataloging and creating environmental ratings of worldwide banks.

Data is harvested from a variety of "data sources." Datasources are then associated with "brands." One brand may be comprised of zero, one, or many data sources.

# Installation and Development

This project uses python 3.10. You will need to install "[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)" (the python package management system) and "[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)" (a python virtual environment manager) to your system. You can install virtualenv like: `sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv`

## Installing Packages

`virtualenv <venv>`

## Activating the virtual environment

`source <venv>/bin/activate`

## Installing packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Deactivating the virtual environment

`deactivate`

## Environment variables
There's an .env file in the same path as settings.py
where all environment variables are and should be placed.
You should *call* them in settings.py and then import them like settings.KEYWORD

## Django commands

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py refresh_datasources banktrack --local all
python manage.py ingest_airtable --local all 
python manage.py runserver
```

## Nginx and Gunicorn userful commands

```
sudo systemctl stop/start/restart nginx
sudo nginx -t
sudo tail -F /var/log/nginx/error.log

sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket
sudo journalctl -u gunicorn.socket
```

## Refreshing Data

### Refresh datasources from API

```
# python manage.py refresh_datasources [DATASOURCE_NAME]
# i.e.
python manage.py refresh_datasources banktrack
# or
python manage.py refresh_datasources all
```

### Refresh datasources from local

```
# python manage.py refresh_datasources [DATASOURCE_NAME] --local [DATASOURCE_NAME]
# i.e.
python manage.py refresh_datasources banktrack --local banktrack
```

## Rate limit in Nginx
Rate limit for endpoint **/graphql** is 10 request/sec for every IP.
To disable it do: `sudo nano etc/nginx/sites-available/bankgreen` and comment out or delete this part:
```
location /graphql {
        limit_req zone=ddos_limit;
        limit_req_status 429;
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/django/gunicorn.sock;
    }
```
`limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=ddos_limit:10m rate=10r/s;` This is the part where **ddos_limit** is defined.

Then restart Nginx and Gunicorn:
`sudo systemctl restart nginx && sudo systemctl restart gunicorn`
