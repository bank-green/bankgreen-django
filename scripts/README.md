# Scripts Directory Readme

This is a directory of scripts that were used to edit data, typically through the django shell.

In this directory, there is no an expectation of good or even working code.

Instead, this is meant to serve as a record of roughly what was has been done through the shell and provide code for future scripts as necessary.
